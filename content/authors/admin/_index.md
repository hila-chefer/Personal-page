I am a Ph.D. Candidate at Tel Aviv University, working in the Deep Learning Lab under the supervision of [Prof. Lior Wolf.](http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~wolf/)

My main interests are computer vision, NLP, and multi-modal learning.
My research is mostly focused on attention-based models and explainable-AI.
