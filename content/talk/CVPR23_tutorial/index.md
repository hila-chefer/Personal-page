title: "[CVPR'23] All Things ViTs: Understanding and Interpreting Attention in Vision (English)"
event: CVPR'23 Tutorial
event_url: 
location: CVPR'23, Vancouver Convention Centre
summary: In this half-day CVPR'23 tutorial, we present the state-of-the-art works on attention explainability and probing. We demonstrate how these mechanisms can be leveraged to guide diffusion models to edit and correct their generated images.
abstract: "The attention mechanism has revolutionized deep learning research across many disciplines starting from NLP and expanding to vision, speech, and more. Different from other mechanisms, the elegant and general attention mechanism is easily adaptable and eliminates modality-specific inductive biases. As attention becomes increasingly popular, it is crucial to develop tools to allow researchers to understand and explain the inner workings of the mechanism to facilitate better and more responsible use of it. This tutorial focuses on understanding and interpreting attention in the vision and the multi-modal setting. We present state-of-the-art research on representation probing, interpretability, and attention-based semantic guidance, alongside hands-on demos to facilitate interactivity. Additionally, we discuss open questions arising from recent works and future research directions."
