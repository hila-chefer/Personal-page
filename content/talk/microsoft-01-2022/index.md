title: Intro to Transformers and Transformer Explainability (English)
event: Data Science Bond Microsoft
event_url: https://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-BOND-Israel/events/283002829/
location: Online event
summary: This talk takes a deep dive into the attention mechanism. During the talk, we review the motivations and applications of the self-attention mechanism. Additionally, we review the main building blocks for self-attention explainability and some cool applications of Transformer-explainability from recent research.
abstract: "In recent years, Transformers have revolutionized deep learning research across many disciplines, starting from NLP and expanding to vision, speech and more. At the heart of the Transformer lies a very simple and intuitive attention mechanism. In this talk, we will explore the main milestones in Transformer-based research, and Transformer explainability research. We will take a closer look into the attention mechanism, and understand its merits and limitations in comparison to Convolutional models. Along the lecture, we will present examples with some of the most famous Transformer-based models such as BERT, CLIP, ViT, DALL-E, and DETR, and discuss the importance and applications of explainability in DNN research, and specifically for Transformers."
