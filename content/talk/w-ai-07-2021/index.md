location: Tel Aviv, Israel
summary: This talk is an intro talk to DNNs and attention, targeted at DL beginners. The talk was given as part of a volunteering program to encourage women to consider research in the deep learning field.
abstract: "Attention-based models, and specifically Transformers, have revolutionized the field of text processing and are becoming increasingly popular in computer vision, speech, and multi-modal tasks.
In this talk, we will discuss the advantages of using such models, and the techniques that enable training these models.
Additionally, we will explore various groundbreaking applications for attention-based models, such as GPT-3 and DALL-E."
